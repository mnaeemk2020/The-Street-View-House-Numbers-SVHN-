# The-Street-View-House-Numbers-SVHN-

SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

The goal of this project is to take an image from the SVHN dataset and determine what that digit is. This is a multi-class classification problem with 10 classes, one for each digit 0-9. Digit '1' has label 1, '9' has label 9 and '0' has label 10.
Although, there are close to 6,00,000 images in this dataset, we have extracted 60,000 images (42000 training and 18000 test images) to do this project. The data comes in a MNIST-like format of 32-by-32 RGB images centred around a single digit (many of the images do contain some distractors at the sides).


Problem statement
In this hands-on project the goal is to build a python code for image classification from scratch to understand the nitty gritties of building and training a model and further to understand the advantages of neural networks. First we will implement a simple KNN classifier and later implement a Neural Network to classify the images in the SVHN dataset. We will compare the computational efficiency and accuracy between the traditional methods and neural networks.
